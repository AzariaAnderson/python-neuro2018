# Edgar's Guide to Introductory Python and Neuroanalysis 2018
Welcome! In this repository, you will find course materials for the Introductory Python and Neuroanalysis course that I am running at Baylor College of Medicine for July 2018. Come back periodically to see new material added as we progress through the course.

## Getting started

### Signing up on Slack

Throughout the course, I will be using [Slack](https://slack.com) for making answering questions and making announcements. Click [**here**](https://join.slack.com/t/edgarsguide/signup) sure to sign up for Edgar's Guide Slack. Your will need to use the school's email address to sign up.

### Installing Python on your system

While the first two sessions will use [Jupyter Hub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) which allows you to dive into Python programming without any setup on your system, you will want to setup and use Python environment on your local machine for later sessions - after all, you are here to learn how to use Python for your own research and development! 

Please follow the instructions below to install Python via [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org) for your respective operating system:

* [macOS](./mac_conda_install.md)
* [Windows](./windows_conda_install.md)
